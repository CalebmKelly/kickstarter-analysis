# Kickstarting with Excel

Overview of Project
# Purpose
- The objective of this Kickstarter project is to seek out various trends and factors that contribute to the success of kickstarter campaigns specific to plays, in an effort to help give Playwright Louise a clear and in-depth analysis. For this project we are going to focus on the outcomes of the launch date, as well as the outcomes based on the kickstarter goals, and the correlation they have with successful campaigns. In addition to an in-depth analysis, graphs will be presented to give a clear visual representation of the kickstarter data.

# Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- In reference to the analysis above, Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts were used to visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch date. Filtering by the years that the fundraiser was launched and by the parent category, helped focus the data to become more relevant towards Louise's fundraiser. The Parent Category of theater was used for this analysis, as Louise's campaign falls under the “play” subcategory. Moreover, the exclusion of fundraisers that were identified as  "Live" supported the analysis in narrowing down the data so only completed fundraisers were analyzed. ]

# Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- In reference to the analysis above, CountIfs functions were applied to visualize data as line charts so that the percentage of campaigns specific to plays that were successful, failed, and canceled, based on the fundraising goal amount could be easily illustrated for Louise. It is important to note that the percentage for canceled campaigns amounts to 0, meaning that all campaigns were successful or failed.

# Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A challenge that was encountered in this project was simply creating the line graph for the analysis of outcomes based on goals. It was troubling to create such a graph, I ran into many errors that caused confusion. Through trial and error, I was able to overcome this challenge and successfully create the line graph that was needed.

# Results
- Conclusions about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the graph that visualizes the outcomes based on the launch date, the most successful Kickstarter campaigns occur within the month of May. Furthermore the success of kickstarter campaigns slowly dwindled following the month of may. It seems that the prime months based on this data are between April and August.

- Conclusions about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Looking at the graph that visualizes the outcomes based on goals, campaigns with over fifty percent success occur on the intervals of “less than 1000 to 19999” and “35000 to 49999.” The campaigns with highest success appear to have goals between “less than 1000” and “4999.” using this data, it may be best for Louise to have a goal between those ranges to maximize her success.

- Some limitations of this dataset?
Although insight is provided from the data that represents the outcomes based on launch date and the outcomes based on goals that show the campaigns that are correlated the most with success, there may be other factors at play. Because Correlation does not mean causation, using this data for Louise's kickstarter does not guarantee success.

- Some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Other tables and or graphs that could have been created to help aid Louise in her kickstarter include an analysis graph that represents outcomes based on the length of the campaign. This could help Louise depict how long her campaign should run for.
